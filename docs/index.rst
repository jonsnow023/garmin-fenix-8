🔄 Types of Maps & Update Methods
1. TopoActive & Outdoor Maps+
These preloaded offline maps are updated via Garmin Express or Wi‑Fi.

Use Watch Settings > Map & Navigation > Map Manager to download, delete, or update regions 


If map data is incomplete or stuck, users have resolved it by uninstalling the map and re-downloading via Express or Wi‑Fi 

2. Google Maps via Connect IQ
Garmin now supports a free Google Maps app on Fenix 8 (and other models) via Connect IQ.

The app enables basic turn-by-turn navigation when paired with an Android phone running Google Maps 

⚙️ How to Perform a Garmin Fenix 8 Map Update
